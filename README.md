- 👋 Hi, I’m @RealMotz, I am a programmer living in Osaka, Japan.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things video games, software and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# in depth, I have been on and off with many different languages so far, but I decided to focus mostly on it. Also, in the past two years and a half I worked as a backend developer using the MeteorJS framework alongside HTML, Javascript and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects mostly, however this repository is going to be full of my tests, prototypes and small/medium projects I want to work on, mostly to learn and grow as a developer.
- 📫 You can contact me at carlos.motta.business@gmail.com.
